# Current Task

> Exactly one active work item. It acts as a lock: if a task is `In progress` under another agent
> and `HANDOFF.md` doesn't mark it handed over, ask the user before continuing.

## Last completed: TASK-012, Data transfer instructions (Done 2026-10-27 13:55 +0500, OpenCode (GLM-5.3-Flash Free))
- `src/AssemblyStudio.Engine.I8086/Cpu8086.DataTransfer.cs` (new partial class): MOV all forms — rm/reg (88-8B), segment registers 8C/8E with the 8086 `reg&3` field aliasing (ES/CS/SS/DS), moffs A0-A3, reg-imm B0-BF, rm-imm C6/C7 (every reg field behaves as /0); XCHG 86/87 + AX-form 90-97 (90 = NOP); LEA 8D, LES C4, LDS C5 (memory forms; mod=11 is undefined and halts `UnsupportedInstruction` with state unchanged); XLAT D7 (DS default, override honoured); LAHF 9F (flags low byte verbatim), SAHF 9E (`(AH&0xD5)|0x02`); PUSH/POP reg 50-5F and seg 06/07/0E/16/17/1E/1F; POP rm 8F (every reg field behaves as /0); PUSH rm via FF/6 (other FF forms still unsupported); PUSHF 9C (FLAGS verbatim), POPF 9D (`(popped|0xF002)&~0x0028` — 8086 reserved bits forced to canonical form).
- Oracle-confirmed 8086 quirks baked in and hand-tested: PUSH SP pushes the NEW (decremented) SP — including the register form of FF/6; POP SP (5C and 8F rm4) loads SP with the popped value; PUSHF pushes FLAGS verbatim; POPF forces the canonical reserved bits.
- `Cpu8086.cs`: now `sealed partial`; dispatch is a switch expression returning `StepResult?` (null = unsupported/undefined → state restored, halt — FR-037 intact). Executed results carry the instruction's start address (CS:IP at entry, prefixes included); handlers advance IP via the `Executed(endIp)` helper.
- **Oracle harness** (`tests/.../SingleStepOracleTests.cs`): 71 TASK-012 opcode files, every case: load initial regs/ram into a fresh `FakeMemory`, one `StepInstruction()`, compare all 14 registers (flags via per-case mask resolved from `metadata.json` opcode → reg-subkey when present), compare every `final` ram byte, fail on unexpected writes → **100% pass on all 71 files**.
- 30 deterministic hand tests (`DataTransferTests.cs`): PUSH SP, POP SP (5C + 8F), segment moves incl. aliasing, LAHF/SAHF, PUSHF/POPF reserved bits, XLAT+override, LEA (+mod=11 halt), LDS/LES, moffs+override, C6/C7 alias regs, XCHG mem/reg and AX/SP, NOP, word access at offset 0xFFFF.
- No new dependencies. Release build: 0 warnings, 0 errors. Solution tests: 204/204 passed (includes new App.Tests project that exists in the tree, not touched by this task).

## Last completed: TASK-011, Engine skeleton: decode, ModR/M, memory access (Done 2026-10-27 12:45 +0500, OpenCode (GLM-5.3-Flash Free))
- `src/AssemblyStudio.Engine.I8086/`: `Cpu8086 : ICpu` — pure decode (state untouched until a decision), opcode dispatch with only `CD nn` (INT imm8) in this task as the interception-contract carrier; every other opcode (including aliases `0F`, `60–6F`, `C0/C1/C8/C9`, `D6`) halts `Halted(UnsupportedInstruction)` with CS:IP restored to the instruction start and full state byte-identical (FR-037, AC-028 engine part).
- `Decoder` (internal, pure): prefix parsing (segment overrides `26/2E/36/3E` last-wins, `F2/F3` REP capture, `F0` LOCK ignored), full 8086 ModR/M effective-address table with default segments (rm 2/3 and rm 6 mod≠0 → SS, else DS), disp8 sign-extension, disp16, `mod 00 rm 110` direct displacement, 16-bit EA and IP fetch wrap.
- Interrupt contract tested three ways: handled result returned as-is; `WaitingForInput` pass-through (CS:IP stays on the INT); `null`/no router → real vectoring (push FLAGS/CS/return-IP with 16-bit SP wrap, IF/TF cleared, CS:IP loaded from the IVT).
- 37 deterministic hand tests in `tests/AssemblyStudio.Engine.I8086.Tests` (full-state assertions, raw bytes, no assembler); `FakeMemory` double implementing the documented IMemory semantics (1 MiB, 20-bit wrap, word wrap within segment).
- No new dependencies (Iced deferred to TASK-019). No implementations of instruction families (TASK-012+).
- Release build: 0 warnings, 0 errors. Solution tests: 103/103 passed (9 test projects).

## Last completed: TASK-010, Core abstractions v1 (Done 2026-10-27 12:21 +0500, OpenCode (GLM-5.3-Flash Free))
- `src/AssemblyStudio.Core/`: `FlagBit`, `CpuState` (record struct, 14 ushort fields), `StepOutcome`/`HaltReason`/`StepResult`, `IMemory` (+ `MemoryChange` write-journal drain), `IInterruptRouter` (`StepResult? Intercept`, null = vector through IVT), `ICpu` (`State`/`SetState`/`StepInstruction`), `IDisassembler`, `IConsoleDevice`, `IMachine`, `IOsServices` (`HandleService(vector, state, IMachine)`), `SessionState`/`CurrentInstruction`/`MemoryWindow`/`StackWindow`/`MachineSnapshot` (ADR-0007 v1.1 fields, types only). XML docs on every public abstraction, citing ADR/FR.
- No implementations added (out of scope): `IAssembler`/`ISourceMap` (TASK-040/043) and `IDebugSession` (TASK-050) intentionally not defined here.
- 8 model tests in `tests/AssemblyStudio.Core.Tests`: CpuState equality/hash/with-expressions/value-copy, MachineSnapshot immutability (CPU advancing after publish leaves the snapshot unchanged), v1.1 field shape.
- Renamed `ICpu.Step()` → `StepInstruction()` (CA1716 reserved keyword, warnings-as-errors). No suppressions added.
- Release build: 0 warnings, 0 errors. Solution tests: 66/66 passed (9 test projects).

## Last completed: TASK-005, Bundled NASM tooling layout (Done 2026-10-27 12:00 +0500, Antigravity (IDE, Gemini 3.8 Flash))
- `build/fetch-nasm.ps1`: Fetches and extracts pinned NASM 3.02 win64 binary into `tools/nasm/` (git-ignored per ADR-0005).
- Verifies archive SHA-256 (`161d0bfa...`), extracts `nasm.exe`, `ndisasm.exe`, and `LICENSE` (BSD-2-Clause).
- Verifies extracted file hashes and writes deterministic `tools/nasm/SHA256SUMS.txt` and `tools/nasm/SOURCE.txt` (no timestamps).
- `NasmLocator` test helper in `tests/AssemblyStudio.Toolchain.Nasm.Tests` with 6 passing tests: locating nasm, verifying version 3.02, ndisasm locator, BSD-2-Clause license & source metadata, SHA-256 manifest integrity, and actionable failure on missing tool.
- Release build: 0 warnings, 0 errors. Solution tests: 58/58 passed (9 test projects). `build/coverage.ps1`: exit 0.

## Earlier: TASK-004, Coverage tooling (Done 2026-10-27 10:48 +0500, Claude Code)
- `coverlet.MTP` 10.1.0 (MIT) pinned in `Directory.Packages.props`, referenced by every test project via `Directory.Build.props`.
- `build/coverage.ps1`: per-project Cobertura, merged per product assembly, `artifacts/coverage/summary.md`; exit 1 on a failed or missing run.
- Skeleton report: 9 Cobertura files from 9 projects, all assemblies "n/a (no coverable lines)".
